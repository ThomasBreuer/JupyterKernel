The GAP 4 package `JupyterKernel`
=================================

This package implements the [Jupyter](https://www.jupyter.org) protocol in GAP.

It is an alternative
to [jupyter-kernel-gap](https://github.com/jupyter-kernel-gap), and should be
more stable, redistributed with GAP 4.9, and (soon) fully compatible with HPC-GAP.
