# The JupyterKernel GAP package 

This package implements the [Jupyter](https://www.jupyter.org) protocol in GAP.

It is an alternative
to [jupyter-kernel-gap](https://github.com/jupyter-kernel-gap), and should be
more stable, redistributed with GAP 4.9, and (soon) fully compatible with HPC-GAP.

## Documentation

Full information and documentation can be found in the manual, available
as PDF `doc/manual.pdf` or as HTML `htm/chapters.htm`, or on the package
homepage at
